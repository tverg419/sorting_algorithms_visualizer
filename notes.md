#Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

**Minimum-Viable Product (MVP)**
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the squares with data points
- As a user, I want to see the colors of currently compared points to be one color and points in their final position to be another color
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the type of algorithm being visualized

| Data Point | Color |
|---|---|
| Unused | Light Gray |
| Compared | Green |
| Final Position | Red |
