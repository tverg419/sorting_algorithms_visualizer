#Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

**Minimum-Viable Product (MVP)**
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the squares with data points
- As a user, I want to see the colors of currently compared points to be one color and points in their final position to be another color
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the type of algorithm being visualized
- As a user, I want to be able to generate a new array

**Stretch Goals**
- As a user, I want to see that code as the algorithm is sorting through the array
- As a user, I want to be able to change the size of the array to see how it sorts.
- As a user, I want to be able to input my own array into the visualizer 

| Data Point | Color |
|---|---|
| Unused | Cyan |
| Compared | Green |
| Final Position | Red |
